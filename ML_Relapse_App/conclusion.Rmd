This Shiny App aimed to develop a predictive model to identify relapse in individuals seeking substance use treatment. Our analysis included logistic regression, LASSO regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), classification and regression trees (CART), and random forest. After training and evaluating the models, it was found that the random forest model outperformed the other models, achieving an AUC ROC of 0.620. Based on the favorable performance of the random forest model during training, it was selected as the best model for predicting relapse. The model was then tested using an independent test data set. The random forest model achieved a prediction accuracy of 61.8% on the test data. This indicates its ability to classify individuals as relapse-prone or not with moderate accuracy. Overall, this Shiny App demonstrated the potential of machine learning models to predict relapse in treatment-seeking individuals with previous substance use.
