A CART model, also known as Classification and Regression Trees, is a machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It creates a decision tree where each internal node represents a feature or attribute, and each leaf node represents a class or predicted value. The model recursively partitions the data based on the selected features, aiming to minimize the impurity or variance within each partition.

Here are some of the key findings from CART model performance,

-   Accuracy: The accuracy metric indicates the overall correctness of the model's predictions is **0.591**.

-   Sensitivity: Sensitivity measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive outcomes out of all actual positive instances which is **0.451** or **45%** approximately.

-   Specificity: Specificity measures the proportion of correctly predicted negative instances out of all actual negative instances which is **0.701** or **70.1%** approximately.

-   Area under the curve ROC: The ROC AUC measures the model's performance across all classification thresholds which is **0.597** in this model.

Using the ROC AUC, Our cart model is able to correctly classify **59.7%** of the cases. In the context of a CART model, this means that the decision tree structure created by the model is able to correctly classify or predict the relapse for about **59.7%** of the instances.
