# Relapse_Dashboard
This dashboard was created in R Shiny to display Machine Learning algorithms developed to predict relapse among people seeking treatment for drug use.


# The Project
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting which individuals are more likely to overcome opioid addiction and which individuals may struggle with recovery. By leveraging the wealth of data from multiple clinical trials conducted within the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), we seek to identify key patient characteristics that influence treatment outcomes. This predictive model can help inform personalized treatment strategies and interventions for individuals with OUD.


# Instructions
(Currently, this is solely for coding review as the outcome variable has been removed. Please contact me for a presentation of the dashboard complete with statistical findings related to the relapse.) 

To build this app, you must first run the "load.R" file, then the "preprocess.R" file to prepare the clinical trial data for the ML algorithms. After preparing the data, run the "models.R" file to prepare the descriptive statistics and build the ML models. (It might also help to run each file listed in the "model.R" file individually).

***TIP*** Be sure to set your working directory to the file where the .R and .rmd files are being held***
